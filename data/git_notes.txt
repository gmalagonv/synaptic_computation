*this happens only once
git init       it starts tracking what is inside the DIRECTORY (the working direcory (pwd)) and its contents  
    git statuts    tells the status of the files in the directory where git init was used



    if github:
        git remote add origin https://github.com/blabla   ths will show up when I click create a new repository in the website.
            note that 'origin' is just a name we give to it.

        git push origin main     it may fail for some reason.....
        git remote remove origin

git reset 88997d5b76f265d80c9718ae45e9e033d8bd89b8 --hard
removes all changes occuring in the between now and the commit whose ID I used. The commits that were afer that one disappeared completely from the repository.



git clone  https://github.com/.....  add a ' .' to copy it inside the working directory instead of creating a new one. This comes wth all the log of the changes vs downloading the zip code.


git pull    gets the last version (from te web?)

to remove all the history delete the .git file:
    check its presence: 
        ls -al
    remove it
        rm -rf .git

 git push heroku main (if in main branch; else:)
 git push heroku production:master

try:
git remote add heroku  https://git.heroku.com/mi-huella.git
